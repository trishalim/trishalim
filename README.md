## Hey, I'm Trisha 👋

I'm a Frontend Engineer with 8 years experience building interactive web apps. I care about good design, solving problems, and making the web more usable one page at a time.

I value users’ needs and reaching business goals. Sometimes, more coding is not the best thing to get us to reach these goals. If my work involves design, talking to users, copywriting, SEO, research, and whatnot - I’m happy to do it!

### Here's how you can get the best out of me
- **Share your ideas, including the bad ones.** Sometimes, the bad ideas lead to the good ones.
- **Communicate well and asynchronously.** Writing, as opposed to calling, doesn’t interrupt my work, and forces you to organize your thoughts. Organizing your thoughts gives you (and me) clarity.
- **Tell me what to do, but leave some autonomy.** I value the freedom to work on what I want and take ownership, but I’m even more motivated when I know that I’m using my time in the best way - working on what is most impactful and will push us towards our goals faster.

If you're looking for someone who is creative, product-focused, experienced in frontend development, and willing to wear multiple hats to get the job done, [email me](mailto:hello@trishalim.com).
